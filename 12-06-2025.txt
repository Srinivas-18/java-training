Hashing:
1. it is an efficient method to store and retrieve elements.  O(1)

2. it's is exactly same as index page in a book. In index page, every topic is associated with a page number. If we want to look some topic, we can directly get the page number from the index.

3. Likewise, in hashing every value will be associated with a key. Using this key, we can point out the element directly.

Quadratic probing 

h(k)=kmod 10
h(k,j)=(h(k)+i*2) mod 10
keys: 42, 16, 91, 33,18, 27, 36, 62

h(36)+1*2 mod 10

Advantage: No extra space primary clustering solved
Disadvantage: Search time O(n), There is no guarantee of finding slot. secondary clustering

36 mod 10
collision occur
h(36)+i*2 mod 10
6+1*2 mod 10
7 mod 10
collision occur
6+2*2 mod 10
