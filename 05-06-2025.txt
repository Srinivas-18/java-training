2. Write a program to Remove outmost Paranthesis?
3. Write a program to convert String to number?
4. Write a program to find the largest Odd number in a string?

# String -Immutable, StringBuffer, StringBuilder
when String object needs to be modified very often we should not use string object.

## StringBuffer -java.lang Mutable class -synchronized class
we cannot make the string literal as mutable by using the StringBuffer.

StringBuffer sb="abc;"

# Synchronized
A thread-safe, mutable sequence of characters.

#StringBuilder- non synchronized class -java. lang -Mutable class -JDK 1.5 ->
A mutable sequence of characters. This class provides an API compatible with StringBuffer, but with no guarantee of synchronization

#Not synchronized
laptop-two browser -chrome -firefox- all play simultaniously

#Method(String Builder)
1. append()
2. insert(offset,"char seq")
3. reverse()
4. deleteCharAt(index)
5. replace(start,end,"char seq")
6. hashCode()
